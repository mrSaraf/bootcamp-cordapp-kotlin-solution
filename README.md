# Bootcamp CorDapp
This project is the template we will use as a basis for developing a complete CorDapp during the bootcamp. Our CorDapp will allow the issuance of tokens onto the ledger.

We'll develop the CorDapp using a test-driven approach. At each stage, you'll know your CorDapp is working once the defined tests pass.

## Set up

1. Download and install Oracle JDK 8 JVM (minimum supported version 8u171)
2. Download and install IntelliJ Community Edition (supported versions 2017.x and 2018.x)
3. Download the `bootcamp-cordapp-kotlin` repository
4. Open IntelliJ. From the splash screen, click `Import Project`, select the `bootcamp-cordapp-kotlin` folder and click `Open`
5. Select `Import project from external model > Gradle > Next > Finish`
  (Gradle will now download all the project dependencies and perform some indexing. This usually takes a minute or so)
6. Click `File > Project Structure…` and select the Project SDK (Oracle JDK 8, 8u171+)

    i. Add a new SDK if required by clicking `New…` and selecting the JDK’s folder

7. Open the `Project` view by clicking `View > Tool Windows > Project`
8. You can now start implementing!

#TODOS - ONCE ALL TESTS PASS.

$ ./gradlew deployNodes (in project root)
#Then, cd build/nodes
$ ./runnodes

#Run Query: (in partyA, partyB shells)
> run vaultQuery contractStateType: kotlin_bootcamp.TokenState

#Flow: (in PartyB shell)
> flow start TokenIssueFlow owner: "PartyA",  amount: 200

Run the query again after executing the above flow
in both shells.
